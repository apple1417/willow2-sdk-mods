# Equip Locker

### Equip Locker v2
Upgraded to v3 sdk.

### Equip Locker v1.4
Fixed that rarity restrictions were all hidden in AoDK.

### Equip Locker v1.3
Added an option to allegiance to enable usable items - fixing that serveral items such as health vials could get restricted.
Removed the last fix for turrets, and instead expliclity excluded vehicles. This fixes that health vials would go into your inventory if they were restricted.

Fixed that it was possible for the mod to lock you out of using items that weren't in your inventory - usually when using turrets.

- The enabled state is now saved over game launches.
- Each restriction set now stores it's options in a nested menu.
Also added the ability to disable entire restriction sets.
